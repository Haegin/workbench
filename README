### My Workbench

Including vim configuration, bin scripts, dotfiles and various useful scripts and configuration files
Install (or refresh) symlinks using

```
$ cd workbench
$ ./bin/benchpress
```

I change and commit to this toolbox regularly, if you want to use this yourself, I suggest you fork this repository or use it purely as a reference.
