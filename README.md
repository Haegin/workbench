## My Workbench

My own vim folder, dotfiles and handy scripts.  Git submodules and pathogen are used for vim plugins.  You can install (or refresh) symlinks to the workbench with;

```
$ cd workbench
$ ./bin/benchpress
```

### The Toolbelt

* Vim
* Tmux

### Disclaimer

I change and commit to this toolbox regularly.  In some rare occasions it might be in a broken state.
If you intend to use this repository yourself, its probably better if you fork it.
