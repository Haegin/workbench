# Use scdl to download tracks from soundcloud playlists to `download_folder`
# after downloading, if #Â of files in `download_folder/playlist` increased an
# apple script is invoked to re-create a playlist in iTunes.
#
# This is not a sync, but is enough for what I want right now :)
# NOTE: non mp3 tracks or tracks that are not downloadable will be skipped
#
# Required: OSX, python3, curl, scdl (https://github.com/flyingrub/scdl)
#   brew install python3 curl
#   pip3 install scdl

# prep folders for downloads
